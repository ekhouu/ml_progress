I've decided to follow along with some [CS221](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2025/assignments/hw1_foundations/index.html) assignments to make sure I am comfortable with programming for ML, and also because I am having fun with some of the math-adjacent stuff :-) I feel like I've become too reliant on AI tools / am not yet used to translating math-y stuff into code, so it's a nice break.
